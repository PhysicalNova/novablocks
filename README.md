# Novablocks

Novablocks is a simple decoration/utility mod that adds blocks (as the name implies).

Currently, I'm working on version 2.0 of NovaBlocks ! 
At the moment, I'm focusing on the structures, a versatile block that you can modify with your trusty Wrenchammer (The abominable amalgamation between a hammer and a wrench, go figure). 
The structure block is quite useful ; You can open a side, pop inside, open another side, pop out the other side, as simple as that ! (Some would call them fancy ladders...)
Plus, the structure can serve as a strut for you builds, making them look ever so solid !
